Script Name: extract_upstream_promoter_sequences.py

Purpose:
This script extracts 1000 bp upstream promoter sequences for a user-defined set of Arabidopsis thaliana gene IDs 
from a reference FASTA file (e.g., TAIR10). It is used to generate custom promoter sets for motif discovery and enrichment analysis.

Inputs:
- A text file containing Arabidopsis gene IDs (with or without transcript versions, e.g. AT1G01010 or AT1G01010.1)
- A FASTA file containing upstream promoter sequences from TAIR
  (e.g., 1000 bp upstream sequences in FASTA format with headers starting with '>AT...')
  
Output:
- A FASTA file with promoter sequences corresponding to the input gene list

Thesis Reference:
- Described in Section 2.2 "Promoter Sequence Extraction"
- Used for generating input to FIMO and STREME motif analysis (Sections 2.3â€“2.4)
